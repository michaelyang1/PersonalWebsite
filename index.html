    <h1>Howdy! I'm Michael Yang</h1>
    <p>I am currently a junior computer science major at Texas A&M University. I've had experiences in <br>
      web development (full-stack), Android application development, and machine learning, specifically <br>
      biometric deep learning, in both academia and industry.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>My first exposure to computer science was in 7th grade. At the time, I was obsessed with <br> 
      the mobile hit Flappy Bird. After playing (and raging) for countless hours, it dawned on me: <br>
      I want to create my own Flappy Bird! That night, I spent hours downloading the IOS SDK kit and <br>
      blindly following a Youtube tutorial coding Flappy Bird line by line, none of which made sense <br>
      to me at the time. In the end, the application failed to compile but the seeds of my fascination<br>
      with programming were planted, launching my long computer science journey. </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Concentration, Mandarin Chinese, Texas A&M University, 2023</p>
    <p>B.S., Computer Science, Texas A&M University, 2023</p>
    <p>High School Diploma, Liberty High School (Frisco, Texas), 2019</p>

    <h2>Hobbies ... for when I'm not coding</h2>
    <p>Hiking and outdoors activities! I've grown very fond of boating in lakes.</p>
    <p>Baking and cooking -- I want to become the Asian Gordon Ramsay ;-)</p>
    <p>Travelling to new places! My next priorities are Yellowstone, Glacier, and Banff national parks. </p>
    <p>And of course video games, especially first person shooters and real time strategy!  </p>
