    <h1>Services</h1>
    <h2> Python for Engineers Lab (ENGR 102) Teaching Assistant</h2>
    <p> As an ENGR 102 teaching assistant, I directed biweekly lab activities and lectures <br>
      for two class sections (~60 students) in an integrated learning environment. I also <br>
      graded coursework, performed code reviews, provided instructional guidance to students, <br>
      and performed data entry duties for grading purposes. In this way, I was able to advance <br>
      the knowledge of fellow engineering students.</p>

    <h2> High School Computer Science Aide</h2>
    <p> As a computer science teacher aide (outside school), I tested programming labs intended <br>
      for Pre-AP and AP students, compiled lab reports, offered algorithmic suggestions, and wrote <br>
      instructional content such as lab specific FAQs. I also installed Java and other computer <br>
      software for my teacher in the computer science classrooms. </p>
